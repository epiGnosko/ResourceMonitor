# ResourceMonitor
This is an open source basic program which shows live system metrics in the terminal itself. Created purely in bash. This is still a work in progress.

## Installation 
This only works for Linux distributions. Simply clone the repo, make the scripts executable and run main.sh
```bash
git clone https://github.com/epiGnosko/ResourceMonitor/
cd ResourceMonitor/
chmod +x *.sh
./main.sh
```
